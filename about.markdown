    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a second-year electrical engineering student at Brigham Young University. I have a passion for circuit design, 3D printing, mathematics, and robotics. I have competed in the BYU Combat Robotics club twice, and I look forward to future seasons. When I'm not in the lab, you'll find me in the great outdoors, hiking or fly-fishing.
